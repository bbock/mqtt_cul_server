# MQTT to CUL bridge

This software package provides a bridge to connect a CUL wireless tarnsceiver
with an MQTT bridge, so that multiple clients (smart home, other apps) can
use it over the network to control various smart home devices.

Currently used and tested with Somfy rollershutters and Brennenstuhl RCS
switchable power sockets (Intertechno-compatible).
